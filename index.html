                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Gruve discovered his passion for music at an early age. Influenced by a wide array of genres, 
                    including Reggae, Punta, Calypso, Soul, Funk, Hip-Hop, and R&B, Gruve’s eclectic musical taste has shaped his career. 
                    His skill in blending these diverse genres is evident in the numerous mixes he has shared online, 
                    capturing the attention of listeners who appreciate a well-rounded musical experience.
                    Throughout the late 1990s, he worked as a DJ, skillfully blending beats and creating memorable atmospheres for his audiences.

                <p>
                    Gruve’s career was temporarily interrupted when he joined the United States Air Force, 
                    where he served for 2 years before being honorably discharged. Most notably he was the first to respond after 9-11 
                    where he was instrumental setting Combined Air Operations Center for US armed forces in the middle east. 
                    However, his time away from DJ’ing did not diminish his love for music. After serving his country, 
                    the pull of music brought him back to the turntables. Since then, he has been performing at various house parties and events in 
                    Houston and its surrounding areas, tailoring his performances to the unique tastes of each audience and ensuring that 
                    every event is filled with energy and excitement.

                    In addition to his live performances, Gruve has focused on expanding his reach through internet radio. 
                    While he takes on live gigs, his true passion lies in sharing music with a global audience through online platforms. 
                    His dedication to curating the perfect sound has allowed him to continue to impress listeners with his mixes, 
                    solidifying his reputation as a talented and versatile DJ.
